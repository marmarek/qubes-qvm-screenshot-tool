# qvm-screenshot-tool

The _**qvm-screenshot-tool**_ is a screenshot tool for [Qubes OS](https://qubes-os.org/)<br>
This tool provide funcionality to make screenshots at Qubes dom0 and upload it automaticaly to AppVM, to imgurl service thought this AppVm and some other taks.
This tool must be places and used only at **dom0** <br>
No need to upload something to TemplateVM.

# How to use it

You will be asked for actions by GUI prompt.`qvm-screenshot-tool` support `ksnapshot` (KDE5 tool) and `scrot` console tool to make screenshots which is not available by default at dom0, but it can by simple installed to it with one command `sudo qubes-dom0-update scrot`<br>

Qubes Team plan to remove `KDE5` from Qubes by default, therefore `ksnapshot` will be also removed. Accordingly, I highly recommend to use it with `scrot`. 

### How to use the tool with Ksnapshot

0. You can start `ksnapshot` first and make your screenshot with it, then start `qvm-screenshot-tool` or you can start `qvm-screenshot-tool` and select `ksnapshot` option at dialog window.
0. After `qvm-screenshot-tool` started. It will popup confirmation dialog. Do not close it, if you are NOT ready to do something with your screenshot at `ksnapshot`! Make screenshot first. 
0. If you are happy with result at `ksnapshot` preview window. Then click `yes` on `qvm-screenshot-tool` dialog.
0. New dialog will be apiared and then you can choose options to upload screenshot etc. (read more below)

### How to use it with scrot

All other options on first dialog use `scrot` tool to make screenshots.

0. Start tool with `./qvm-screenshot-tool` or hotkey which you already setup (see install section)
0. Choose e.g. `region or window` 
0. Simple click on window to make screeshot of that window. Drag mouse with left button down to select region of the screen.

Installation

## WARNING! ALWAYS REVIEW ANY CODE THAT YOU UPLOAD TO DOM0 BEFORE DO THAT!
First, you **must** review the code, before upload it to dom0 ! Always do that if you are uploading code to dom0 from some 
other source and other way then Qubes Team recommend it !!!

### Manual install

Just save `qvm-screenshot-tool.sh` as a file to any AppVM. Then copy it to `dom0` with the following command at dom0 terminal:

```shell
qvm-run --pass-io NAMEOFAPPVM 'cat /path/to/qvm-screenshot-tool.sh' > /home/user/Pictures/qvm-screenshot-tool.sh
```
Then give it execute privilegies at dom0 terminal:

```shell
chmod +x /home/user/Pictures/qvm-screenshot-tool.sh
```

Now, you can setup hotkeys. Go to System -> Keyboard settings and bind it to your default shortcut for `PrintScreen` key or add to e.g. `Ctrl+PrintScreen` combination..

Also you can start ot from dom0 terminal to get full verbose output:

```shell

Dependencies
----

Most are probably pre-installed at `Qubes OS` by default.<br>
Tested at 3.2rc1 

* **Linux only AppVMs supported**
* curl at Linux AppVM
* zenity at dom0 and at AppVM. 
* scrot at dom0 <i>(recommended) or ksnapshot</i>
* xclip at AppVM <i>(only need if you want also copy url to clipboard automaticaly att AppVM)</i>

OS support
----
Qubes OS only. :-) 

This will not fully work on Windows AppVMs. Only if Qubes Team will add something like cygwin. But are you really want Windwos support for uploading images to imgurl service? <br>
